# Introduction

This repo contains code for the Moldzilla project.

The aim of the Moldzilla project was to use data mining and machine learning to predict the probability of walls developing mold. Parameters used as input in the data were wall materials and wall thickness, among others.

## Technology

Machine learning classifiers were built in Python with [scikit-klearn](http://scikit-learn.org) and code and sample data can be seen in `classifier` folder.

A mock frontend was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and can be seen in `frontend` folder. The folder's readme file contains further instructions on how to set up the frontend. A demo of the frontend can be seen [here](https://gellati.github.io/moldzilla/).
